        "Modern cosmology rests on the ΛCDM framework, which successfully predicts Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies and Large Scale Structure (LSS) formation at ~10% precision. However, systematic deviations emerge across multiple independent observables when moving from cosmic scales to galactic systems:\n",
