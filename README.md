# Matter-Originated Spacetime Gradient Model (MOSGM)

**Author:** Tarun Kumar Saxena  
**Affiliation:** Independent Researcher, India  

## Overview
The Matter-Originated Spacetime Gradient Model (MOSGM) is a phenomenological gravity framework proposing that spacetime properties do not exist independently of matter. Instead, spacetime gradients emerge from large-scale matter distributions and induce small, environment-dependent corrections to standard gravitational dynamics.

The model is formulated to address galaxy rotation curve residuals without invoking non-baryonic dark matter particles, while preserving the local successes of General Relativity.

## Key Features
- Denies matter-free spacetime as a physical entity  
- Introduces spacetime gradients sourced by large-scale matter distributions  
- Predicts environment-dependent gravitational corrections  
- Fully falsifiable using observational galaxy data  
- Does not introduce new dark matter particles
