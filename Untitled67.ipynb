        "\n",
        "## 3.1 MOSGM Baseline Recap\n",
        "The **Matter-Originated Spacetime Geometry Model (MOSGM)** is founded on the operational premise that gravitational behaviour is determined by matter distributions and their spatial inhomogeneities. In its baseline form, MOSGM provides an effective description of galactic dynamics by relating observed gravitational responses to matter-induced spacetime gradients.\n",
        "\n",
        "The baseline MOSGM formulation successfully captures key features of rotation curve diversity in isolated and field galaxies without invoking discrete dark matter particles. However, it is intentionally minimal and does not attempt to describe all regimes of cosmic structure formation.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Note:** This section serves only as a contextual recap. All assumptions carried forward from MOSGM are explicitly stated, and no additional degrees of freedom are introduced at this stage.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3.2 Extension to CCDM\n",
        "While MOSGM accounts for a wide range of galactic-scale phenomena, its baseline formulation underestimates suppression effects observed in high-density environments such as galaxy groups and clusters. To address this limitation, the framework is extended to include a **Continuum Coupled Dynamics Modification (CCDM)**.\n",
        "\n",
        "CCDM preserves the matter–spacetime inseparability central to MOSGM while introducing a smooth continuum component that contributes to gravitational response in an environment-dependent manner. This component is:\n",
        "* **Not** treated as a discrete particle population.\n",
        "* Treated as a **dynamically relevant background** that couples to matter-induced spacetime gradients.\n",
        "\n",
        "The CCDM extension is therefore additive in scope but conservative in interpretation. It enables a controlled interpolation between galactic and cluster-scale behaviour within a single phenomenological framework.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3.3 Definition of the $\\Omega$ Variable\n",
        "A central organizing quantity in MOSGM-CCDM is the dimensionless variable $\\Omega$, which parameterizes the dynamical regime of a system based on its matter environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Operationally, $\\Omega$ encodes the relative influence of local matter density, extended environmental density, and their spatial gradients on the effective gravitational response. It is **not a fundamental constant**, but a derived quantity constructed from measurable properties of the matter distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Roles of $\\Omega$\n",
        "1.  **Classification:** Categorizes systems into distinct dynamical regimes.\n",
        "2.  **Transition:** Governs the \"smoothness\" between regime dominance.\n",
        "3.  **Representation:** Provides a compact way to express environment-dependent behaviour.\n",
        "\n",
        "*The explicit functional form of $\\Omega$ is introduced in later chapters. At the conceptual level, $\\Omega$ is a regime indicator rather than an independent dynamical field.*\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3.4 Core Model Assumptions\n",
        "The MOSGM-CCDM framework operates under a clearly defined and limited set of assumptions:\n",
        "* Gravitational dynamics are treated in the **classical, weak-field regime**.\n",
        "* Matter distributions are described using **smooth, coarse-grained densities**.\n",
        "* Effective gravitational response may **vary with environment**.\n",
        "* **No modification** of fundamental physical constants is assumed.\n",
        "* **Standard gravitational behaviour** is recovered in appropriate limits.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3.5 Internal Consistency Conditions\n",
        "For MOSGM-CCDM to remain physically meaningful, three internal consistency conditions are enforced:\n",
